## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hoangtuan2k5/dsa-leetcode-training.git
   ```

2. Navigate to any topic folder (e.g., array/easy/) to start working on problems.

3. Open the corresponding Java file for each problem. Each file contains the solution and, where necessary, explanations.

4. Feel free to add your own solutions and diagrams to the corresponding folder.

5. You can run the Java code directly using your favorite IDE or command line:
   ```bash
   javac ProblemName.java
   java ProblemName
   ```

6. For diagrams or additional explanations, check the docs/ folder within each topic folder.
